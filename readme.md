# Sphax Bigger Reactors Patch [512x - 32x]
This is a reorg of the original 
[Big Reactors Sphax Patch](https://bdcraft.net/community/releases-for-mods-f9/big-reactors-t1550.html)
for Minecraft 1.7 and parts of the 
[Extreme Reactors Sphax Patch](https://bdcraft.net/community/work-progress-f8/extreme-reactors-t6159.html)
for Minecraft 1.12, updated for the official continuation of Big Reactors, 
[Bigger Reactors](https://github.com/BiggerSeries/BiggerSeries) and Minecraft 1.16.5. As far as I am aware, this is
the only Sphax patch for Bigger Reactors, so textures will continue to be updated/added here as more functionality
is added to the Bigger Reactors mod.
